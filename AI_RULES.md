# Global Rules (Draft)

- Keep functions small and pure; prefer composition.
- Type everything (TS) / use pydantic/typing (Py).
- Add tests for new logic; keep 80%+ coverage on critical paths.
- Use ENV vars for secrets; never commit secrets.
- Write a short README update with each feature.
- Prefer pnpm (JS) and uv (Python) in this repo.
